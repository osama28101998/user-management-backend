User Management Backend

This backend, built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB, provides APIs for user management, role-based access control, and permissions. API routes are defined in src/routes/ (authRoutes.ts, userRoutes.ts, roleRoutes.ts, permissionRoutes.ts) using Express Router, with endpoints for user registration, login, CRUD operations on users, roles, and permissions, and role/permission assignment. Middleware (authMiddleware.ts, roleMiddleware.ts) enforces JWT authentication and permission checks. Since the requirements didnâ€™t specify initial user creation, I temporarily disabled middleware for /api/permissions, /api/roles, and /api/users/assign-role to create the first admin user, role, and permissions via Postman, then restored middleware to stay within scope.
